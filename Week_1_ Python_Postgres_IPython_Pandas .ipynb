      "# Week 1: Python/Postgres/Ipython/Pandas\n",
      "Week one was all about getting your programming up to par.\n",
      "\n",
      "Class would start at 930 with a mini quiz. Basically a warm up to get yourself in the data mood. Then we would move on to the morning lecture. Introducing a new idea/frame work of how to do things. After that we moved onto the indiviudal assignment for the day. Here we explore the idea in the first lecture and get our feet wet in that area. Time absolutely flew by this first week. After the individual assignment and lunch (free mini food at galvanize btw) it was on to the afternoon lecture. This time we take the topic that we learned in the morning and go more in depth. The lectures are not necessarily meant to teach you all the little details, but rather show you what is possible, get the ideas in your head, and prepare you enough to go out and try/fail/succeed repeat on your own. Once the afternoon lecture is done we move on to the pair programming assignment. This is usually a much larger task and one that requires a ton of pre planning. I've been fortunate to have good partners and learn a ton from other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent the weekend preping for week 2 which is all about statistics. Although week 1 was tiring, it wasn't conceptually difficult to grasp the topics. I know stats however, is going to be a little more difficult. I'm exicted to see what the best practices are in the work place when it comes to the hardcore math\n",

      "Material:\n",
      "1. Python, intros\n",
      "2. SQL Zoo, Postgres\n",
      "3. Pandas\n",
      "4. All around best practices for exploratory data analysis\n",

      "Lets get into a little code from the week. Here is a large portion of a blackjack game, [GScott](https://github.com/gscottstukey) and I did. The goal of the game was to get your OOP up to speed. "
